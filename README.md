## BYI



dont use they/them on me. **only** use she/her, unless close friends (moots in the list). im aroace, so please dont flirt with me. i have typing quirk! example,, "hi uhh i ate fries today:)" (not exactly nervous, but i have a hard time on choosing words, as well as reading. im slow.) "hi!! thank you ;; you too:D" (';;' or '::' meant to be a large space, neutual or smt shruggsss) and double characters "hi im gooooddd hbuu" (normal, just exited or neutual:))
i dont use tonetags, please ask me to use them on you or smt. but you must use tonetags on me, (only /j or /srs, gen).

i dont exactly ship those like, "harlequin x pierrot" i saw them as brothers and i think they are😭 avoid talking to me about this topic if you ship those ;; youre on thin ice.

dont mention about any ships on pierrot, jester or harlequin (ex, pierrot x columbina) i dont like seeing my f/o being with another women ;; in game !! selective yume on those 3 twinks also :-) i share with moots

i dont exactly love having people calling me ho, bitch or anything. so do not call me those unless close moots! i will block or hide:-)
